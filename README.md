# Hi, I'm Anil Paudel! ðŸ‘‹  

Iâ€™m a **Computer Engineering graduate** from **Pulchowk Campus, IOE**, currently working as an **LLM researcher and AI engineer**. My passion lies in **AI/ML**, especially in building intelligent systems powered by large language models, multi-agent collaboration, and Generative AI.  

ðŸ“š **Focus Areas:**  
- Large Language Models (LLMs) & Prompt Engineering  
- Multi-Agent Systems & Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)  
- AI Research, System Development & Technical Blogging ([paudelanil9.com.np](https://paudelanil9.com.np/))  

ðŸŒ± **Skills:**  
- Programming: **Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch, React, JavaScript**  
- Frameworks/Tools: **Docker, Git, YOLO, Hugo, DevOps Fundamentals**  
- Specialization: **NLP, Image Processing, LLMs, Model Fine-Tuning**  

## âœ¨ Highlights  

- **'Saral Yatra'**: An NFC-based digital payment service project.  
- **Emotion-Based Music Recommender**: Classified facial emotions and recommended music accordingly. [GitHub](https://github.com/paudelanil/MinorProject)  
- **Nepali Handwritten Document Conversion**: Built a custom OCR system using encoder-decoder models and YOLOv8 for Devanagari script recognition. [GitHub](https://github.com/paudelanil/nepali-handwriten-conversion)  
- **LLM from Scratch**: Reimplemented the core components of transformer-based LLMs by following *Build a Large Language Model (from scratch)*. [GitHub](https://github.com/paudelanil/LLM-from-scratch)  
- **DevOps CI/CD Pipeline**: Built a complete CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins and Docker with integrated monitoring and alerting via Prometheus and Grafana. Enabled automated builds, deployments, and system observability for production-grade reliability.  
- **Kaggle Competitor**: Participated in multiple ML competitions. [Kaggle Profile](https://www.kaggle.com/sunshinesunshine)
